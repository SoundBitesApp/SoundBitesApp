<p>
SoundBites is an app that matches up <strong>food</strong> with <strong>music</strong>
</p>

<p>For example, Lemon Meringue Pie almost always starts in A major - wouldn't it be nice if the perfect piece of music could augment your enjoyment? Or perhaps that cucumber salad would taste even better with a bit of Miles Davis in the background.</p>

<p>
SoundBites helps you find the music to match your tastes, and vice-versa. This makes thinking about music and food fun and interesting - and might make fussy eaters try new foods if only to find out what they sound like.
</p>

<p>
It also helps people understand <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia">taste synesthesia</a>.

<a name="how-it-works" class="anchor" href="#how-it-works"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How It Works</h3>

  <h4>1. Plate It.</h4>
  <p>Tell SoundBites what you're eating, or take take a picture of your food.</p>

  <h4>2. Rate It.</h4>
  <p>Now Rate your food using various categories. How sweet is it? Is it Salty? Spicy? Crunchy? Does it taste bitter? </p>

  <h4>3. Hear It.</h4>
  <p>SoundBites searches its database and finds music to match your food.</p>

  <h4>4. Train It.</h4>
  <p>Train SoundBites with your musical preferences to get better recommendations. You can also suggest music/food pairings of your own.</p>

<p>
As people train SoundBites with their musical tastes, it begins to see patterns in how people think about food and music. The idea would be to collect a massive database  - perhaps one day we might be able to make recipes based on particular tunes, but in the meantime it'll be interesting to see what happens...
</p>

<p>
The whole idea is to make thinking about music and food fun and interesting.

<a name="history" class="anchor" href="#history"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>History</h3>
<p>
It began with donuts. 
</p>

<p>
During the wee hours of the <a href="http://www.musictechfest.org">Boston Music Techfest 2014</a> hackathon we music hackers paused to have breakfast. While we were munching <a href="http://www.perfect440.com">LJ</a> mentioned that she heard different kinds of music whenever she ate.
</p>

<p>
Musical tastes? Interesting. 
</p>

<p>
We started feeding LJ a steady stream of donuts, and she played what she heard on the piano. Shimmery arpeggios for chocolate glaze, sedated minor keys for doughy plain donuts.
</p>

<p>
This was fascinating! We thought about how interesting it would be to find out what other people heard when they taste.
</p>

<p>Soon <a href="http://perfect440.com">LJ</a>, <a href="http://github.com/danman01">Danny</a>, and <a href="http://github.com/adorsk">Alex</a> worked up some mockups, and thus was born the idea for SoundBites.
